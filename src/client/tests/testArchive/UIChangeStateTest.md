Goal: test if I could dynamically change state of inventory with prepared events
## Tests:
getSelectedSlot():
    - Output: nil
    - Reason: player had no slot selected(correct)

setItemInfo():
    - Output: UI changed according to input
    - Reason: we wanted to test how dynamically it get changed
