# Frameworks

This game uses a few framework for better developing experience
Used frameworks are:
Flamework - wrapper for whole game, makes running some processes easier
Roblox-TS - Roblox in typescript. With typescript syntax it's much easier to find out some bugs
Asphalt - It's pretty hard to import assets manually into roblox so that's why we use Flamework which does everything for us!
Rojo - Well, we need to import our code into roblox after everything and that's what is Rojo here for
@rblxts/react - React like UI framework! You can use JSX to make XML like UI structure
